# work-day-scheduler

## Description

Using the starter CSS and HTML code provided I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The starter code uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time.  

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner - THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down - THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day - THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a time block - THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block - THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page - THEN the saved events persist
